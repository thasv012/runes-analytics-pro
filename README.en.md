# üîÆ RUNES Analytics Pro

## üîç Overview
RUNES Analytics Pro is a modular, gamified analytics platform dedicated to Runes tokens on Bitcoin. The platform provides comprehensive tracking of whale movements, social sentiment analysis, real-time market insights, and quantum resonance visualization, all presented through cutting-edge interactive dashboards. Our solution bridges the gap between on-chain data and market psychology, offering traders and enthusiasts unprecedented visibility into the emerging Runes ecosystem.

## üèó Architecture
RUNES Analytics Pro follows a modular system architecture designed for scalability and performance:

- **ApiManager**: Core component that provides unified access to external APIs (Ordiscan, Magic Eden, OKX, GeniiData) with standardized error handling, rate limiting, and authentication
  
- **Data Services**: Intermediate layer responsible for data parsing, normalization across different sources, and transformation into consistent internal formats

- **Visualization Layer**: Collection of responsive dashboard components and canvas-based visualizations, including the innovative ResonanceRadar for quantum field analysis

- **Quantum Analysis Engine**: Cross-domain processing system that generates insights by correlating market data, social sentiment, and on-chain metrics

The platform implements an intelligent cache system with variable TTL (Time-To-Live) that adapts based on data volatility: 5 minutes for market rankings, 10 minutes for token details, and 3 minutes for transaction data. This strategy significantly reduces API calls, enhances user experience, and optimizes resource usage.

## üé® Design & UX
The platform features a distinctive Cyberpunk-inspired user interface:

- Rich, immersive dark themes dominated by cyan, neon green, and purple accents
- Technical, monospaced fonts (Share Tech Mono, Rajdhani) that enhance the digital aesthetic
- Interactive charts with responsive animations and hover effects
- Visual enhancements including subtle scanline effects, controlled glitch animations, and pulsing neon highlights for important data points
- Theme switcher offering four distinct visual experiences: Dark (default), Ocean, Light, and Cyberpunk

The UI is designed to be both visually engaging and functionally efficient, presenting complex data in an intuitive manner while maintaining the cyberpunk maritime aesthetic.

## MAIN IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Redesigned interface

- ** Modern and intuitive design **: UI completely updated with Tailwind CSS and custom components
- ** customizable dashboard **: configurable widgets that allow the user to create their own analysis flow
- ** Responsive System **: Perfect adaptation for mobile devices, tablets and desktops
- ** Light/Dark theme **: Visual customization options for different preferences and environments

## Technical Architecture

### API Manager

The heart's heart is `Apimanager`, a robust architecture for API management:```javascript
// Arquitetura simplificada do ApiManager
class ApiManager {
  constructor(options) {
    this.services = [];
    this.cacheManager = new CacheManager();
    this.rateLimiters = {};
    this.fallbackStrategies = options.fallbackStrategies || 'sequential';
  }
  
  registerService(service) { /* Registra um novo servi√ßo de API */ }
  orchestrateRequest(method, params) { /* Gerencia o fluxo de requisi√ß√µes */ }
  applyFallbackStrategy(method, params) { /* Implementa alternativas em caso de falha */ }
}
```
Main features:

- ** Dynamic Service Registration **: Addition and removal of data sources without system interruption
- ** Fallback strategies **: sequential, parallel or personalized for maximum availability
- ** Data validation **: Integrity verification of data received before processing
- ** automatic transformations **: normalization of data from different sources for a unified format

### Cache System

The cache layer is critical for performance optimization:```javascript
// Implementa√ß√£o simplificada do CacheManager
class CacheManager {
  constructor() {
    this.memoryCache = {};
    this.persistentCache = new PersistentStorage();
    this.strategies = {
      'tokens': { ttl: 300, invalidation: 'time-based' },
      'market': { ttl: 60, invalidation: 'time-based' },
      'whales': { ttl: 600, invalidation: 'event-based' }
    };
  }
  
  get(key, category) { /* Recupera dados do cache */ }
  set(key, data, category) { /* Armazena dados no cache */ }
  invalidate(pattern) { /* Invalida cache baseado em padr√£o */ }
}
```
Benefits implemented:

- ** multi-level cache **: Memory for frequent, persistent data for stable data
- ** Intelligent invalidation **: Time based or events to keep updated data
- ** Automatic compression **: Data size reduction to save resources
- ** Hit/Miss Statistics **: Monitoring for continuous optimization

### Gamification System

Gamification architecture is designed to maximize engagement:```javascript
// Estrutura do sistema de gamifica√ß√£o
class GamificationSystem {
  constructor(userId) {
    this.userId = userId;
    this.progressTracker = new ProgressTracker();
    this.rewardManager = new RewardManager();
    this.achievementRules = loadRulesFromDB();
  }
  
  trackActivity(activity, metadata) { /* Registra atividade do usu√°rio */ }
  evaluateAchievements() { /* Verifica conquistas desbloqueadas */ }
  calculateLevel() { /* Determina n√≠vel atual do usu√°rio */ }
  issueRewards(achievementId) { /* Concede recompensas */ }
}
```
Implemented features:

- ** Level System **: Progression based on use and discoveries on the platform
- ** Unlockable achievements **: rewards for specific actions and milestones
- ** Login Streak **: Bonuses by consistent use of the platform
- ** daily missions **: tasks that encourage the exploration of different features
- ** Classification Table **: Friendly competition between platform users
