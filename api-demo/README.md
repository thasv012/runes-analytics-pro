# 🚀 RUNES Analytics Pro - Interactive Demo

An immersive interactive experience for analyzing Runes tokens on Bitcoin L1.

## 🧬 About the Project

RUNES Analytics Pro is an exclusive analytics platform for Runes tokens, featuring an intuitive interface, gamified design, integration with multiple APIs, and curated data to optimize the user experience.

This interactive demo showcases:

- 🌐 **Genesis Pulse** - Pulsating neural interface that reacts to blockchain data
- 🧠 **Modular Intelligence** - Advanced caching, unified API, and indexing system
- 🐋 **Whale Tracker** - Real-time monitoring of major investor movements
- 💬 **Neural Pulse Vision** - AI capable of analyzing and explaining any Rune token

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser
3. Interact with the interface elements:
   - Click on the Genesis Pulse to activate the neural interface
   - Click the "Activate Neural Consultant" button to activate the AI chat interface
   - Ask questions about any Rune token to get instant analysis

## 🧪 Advanced Features

For developers and technical enthusiasts, there are hidden features:

### Console Commands

Open the browser console (F12) and type:

```js
window.awakenNeuralPulse()
```

This command activates the advanced mode of Genesis Pulse and returns an object with detailed information.

### Debug Mode

Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to activate debug mode, which allows for:

- Simulation of Cursor connection
- LM Studio integration
- GPU acceleration
- Real-time monitoring of Runes detection

### LLM Integration

The platform now includes integration with local language models through LM Studio:

1. Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) on your machine
2. Download a compatible model (like Mistral-7B-Instruct)
3. Start the local server in LM Studio (default port: 1234)
4. The application will automatically connect to your local LLM

If no LLM is available, the system gracefully falls back to simulation mode, providing realistic responses based on the known context for major Rune tokens.

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Implementation of real Bitcoin API connection
- Integration with Ordinals indexers
- Customized alert system
- Expansion of the gamification module
