## Main Improvements

### 1. Redesigned Interface

- **Modern and Intuitive Design**: New color palette optimized for data analysis, improved typography for better readability, native dark mode to reduce eye strain, smooth transitions and animations between components
- **Customizable Dashboard**: Draggable widgets for personalized organization, automatic saving of user configuration, pre-configured templates for different use cases, advanced filters with history of recent searches
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Interactive charts with zoom and period selection, side-by-side comparison of multiple tokens, export of data and charts in multiple formats, advanced visualizations (heat map, bubble chart, etc.)
- **Full Responsiveness**: Perfect adaptation from smartphones to ultrawide monitors, optimized interface for tablets and touch devices, support for intuitive gestures on mobile devices, synchronization of preferences between devices

## Technical Architecture

### API Manager

The heart of the system is the `ApiManager`, a robust architecture for API management:

```javascript
// Simplified ApiManager architecture
class ApiManager {
  constructor(options) {
    this.services = [];
    this.cacheManager = new CacheManager();
    this.rateLimiters = {};
    this.fallbackStrategies = options.fallbackStrategies || 'sequential';
  }
  
  registerService(service) { /* Registers a new API service */ }
  orchestrateRequest(method, params) { /* Manages the request flow */ }
  applyFallbackStrategy(method, params) { /* Implements alternatives in case of failure */ }
}
```

Main features:

- **Dynamic Service Registration**: Addition and removal of data sources without system interruption
- **Fallback Strategies**: Sequential, parallel or customized for maximum availability
- **Data Validation**: Verification of data integrity received before processing
- **Automatic Transformations**: Normalization of data from different sources to a unified format

### Cache System

The cache layer is fundamental for performance optimization:

```javascript
// Simplified implementation of CacheManager
class CacheManager {
  constructor() {
    this.memoryCache = {};
    this.persistentCache = new PersistentStorage();
    this.strategies = {
      'tokens': { ttl: 300, invalidation: 'time-based' },
      'market': { ttl: 60, invalidation: 'time-based' },
      'whales': { ttl: 600, invalidation: 'event-based' }
    };
  }
  
  get(key, category) { /* Retrieves data from cache */ }
  set(key, data, category) { /* Stores data in cache */ }
  invalidate(pattern) { /* Invalidates cache based on pattern */ }
}
```

Implemented benefits:

- **Multi-level Cache**: Memory for frequent data, persistent for stable data
- **Intelligent Invalidation**: Based on time or events to keep data updated
- **Automatic Compression**: Reduction of data size to save resources
- **Hit/Miss Statistics**: Monitoring for continuous optimization

### Gamification System

The gamification architecture was designed to maximize engagement:

```javascript
// Structure of the gamification system
class GamificationSystem {
  constructor(userId) {
    this.userId = userId;
    this.progressTracker = new ProgressTracker();
    this.rewardManager = new RewardManager();
    this.achievementRules = loadRulesFromDB();
  }
  
  trackActivity(activity, metadata) { /* Records user activity */ }
  evaluateAchievements() { /* Checks unlocked achievements */ }
  calculateLevel() { /* Determines current user level */ }
  issueRewards(achievementId) { /* Grants rewards */ }
}
```

Implemented functionalities:

- **Level System**: Progression based on usage and discoveries on the platform
- **Unlockable Achievements**: Rewards for specific actions and milestones reached
- **Login Streak**: Bonuses for consistent use of the platform
- **Daily Missions**: Tasks that encourage exploration of different features
- **Leaderboard**: Friendly competition between platform users
