### üìå Direction Notes

- Maintain fluidity between transitions
- Green particles are a consistent visual element connecting all scenes
- Visual rhythm should follow the escalation and decrease of the soundtrack
- The Cypher Runecard should have maximum detail possible from the existing version
- Allow subtle micro-movements in all static elements to create "living" feel
