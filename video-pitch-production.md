# üé• RUNES Analytics Pro - Production Notes

## üìã Technical Specifications

- **Format:** 16:9, minimum 1080p (4K recommended)
- **Duration:** 60-90 seconds + 5s for Easter Egg
- **Primary Color Palette:** Tropical green (#00FF9C) on Satoshi black (#0a0a0a)
- **Secondary Palette:** Cybernetic blue (#00B4FC) for highlights and accents

## üé® Art Direction

### Visual References
- Matrix (green code aesthetic)
- Ghost in the Shell (translucent interfaces)
- Blade Runner 2049 (atmosphere and lighting)
- Classic UNIX/Linux terminals
- Tron Legacy (data visualization and illumination)

### Graphic Elements
- **Particles:** Small green points and lines simulating data in motion
- **Typography:** Monospaced fonts for technical text, elegant serif for quotes
- **Runecards:** Use established Cypher design with glow and displacement effects

## üîä Sound Design

### Sound Effects
- **Environment:** Low-frequency white noise simulating server rooms
- **Interface:** Subtle clicks for transitions and text appearances
- **Energy:** Electricity/data flow sounds when green elements appear
- **Glitches:** Digital distortion at key moments (1-2 instances only)

### Music Track
- **Style:** Lo-fi with ambient and cyberpunk elements
- **BPM:** Start slow (60-70) and gradually increase until Act III (90-100)
- **Instrumentation:** Analog synthesizers, deep bass, minimalist electronic percussion
- **Progression:** Builds through Acts I-IV, then gradually deconstructs in Act V

## üó£Ô∏è Narration

### Voice
- **Type:** Male, deep, mature, with texture and gravitas
- **Processing:** Light reverb and delay (30-50ms)
- **Cadence:** Dramatic pauses between key phrases
- **Reference:** Blend of Morpheus (Matrix) prophetic tone with Blade Runner narrator gravity

### Timing
- Rehearse to ensure key textual points coincide with visual transitions
- Allow sonic space between phrases for visual effects to "breathe"
- Final whispered lines should be delivered with intimate closeness to microphone

## üì± On-Screen UI/UX

### Dashboard (Act II)
- Pulsing line graphs with subtle movement
- Token cards with gentle hover effects
- Filtering system with interactive elements
- Color scheme consistent with visual identity

### Terminal (Act V and Easter Egg)
- Font: Fira Code or similar (monospaced with ligatures)
- Typing effect: 20-30ms between characters
- Cursor blinking at 500ms rate
- Occasional glitches simulating interference

## üé¨ Animation Sequence

### Recommended Techniques
- **Transitions:** Smooth dissolves (300-500ms) between main acts
- **Text appearance:** Gradual fade in or typing effect
- **Cypher Runecard:** Entry with "conjuration" effect - converging particles
- **Keywords:** Float in with slight 3D movement and rotation

### Easter Egg
- Simulate screen failure for 500ms before displaying terminal
- Bright green text (subtle pulse)
- Disappears abruptly with "CRT shutdown" effect

## üìÖ Suggested Timeline
- **0:00-0:10** - Act I (The Genesis Whisper)
- **0:10-0:25** - Act II (The Awakening)
- **0:25-0:40** - Act III (The Architecture of Vision)
- **0:40-0:55** - Act IV (The Covenant)
- **0:55-1:15** - Act V (The Cypher Whisper)
- **1:15-1:20** - Easter Egg

## üé≠ Visual Treatment

### Lighting
- Dramatic contrast between light and dark areas
- Light sources primarily from digital elements
- Subtle volumetric rays in key moments
- "Aura" glow around important elements

### Texture
- Subtle "film grain" noise for analog character
- Very light chromatic aberrations at edges of bright objects
- Controlled "bloom" effect on green light sources
- Strategic small glitches and distortions

### Camera Movement
- Fluid camera with smooth movements
- Variable depth of field to highlight elements
- Subtle rack focus between foreground and background elements
- Slow drift during contemplative moments

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Align visual rhythm with music track beats
- Do not overload screen with information - prefer minimalism
- Test video on different devices to ensure readability
- The Cypher Runecard should be the focal point of Act IV - allow time for appreciation
- Render with high-quality codec - avoid compression artifacts in dark areas
- Consider subtle audio binaural effects for immersive listening experience
